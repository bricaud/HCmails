# A simple analysis of H. Clinton's mails to show how graphs can help extracting information from data

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook used to extract the information and make the graph from the mails using Python. Each step is explained in the notebook. Click on the file [exploreHCmails.ipynb](https://github.com/bricaud/HCmails/blob/master/exploreHCmails.ipynb) to display the steps.

The dataset (emails) is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/hillary-clinton-emails). 

An explanation of the analysis is given in a blog post [here](https://bricaud.github.io/personal-blog/graph-of-words-from-emails/). 

The interactive graph can be found on the [project Github page](https://bricaud.github.io/HCmails/).
